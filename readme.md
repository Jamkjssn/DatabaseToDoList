## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a settings menu to let the user adjust the way it works to their own preferences
* [ ] Within settings menu add a sorting preference, this would be used to set the order in which tasks are displayed(Chronological, importance, alphabetical, etc.)
* [ ] Within settings add an option to always display completed tasks.
* [ ] Right now Tasks can be deleted but subtasks cannot
