## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* Youtube: [Python - How To Create Firestore Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsFYq_1BQdk)

* Firebase website: [Get started with Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)

* Medium: [How to access nested sub-collections in Firebase](https://medium.com/@rzcodes/how-to-access-nested-sub-collections-in-firebase-c678664c621c)


## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a settings menu to let the user adjust the way it works to their own preferences
* [ ] Within settings menu add a sorting preference, this would be used to set the order in which tasks are displayed(Chronological, importance, alphabetical, etc.)
* [ ] Within settings add an option to always display completed tasks.
* [ ] Right now Tasks can be deleted but subtasks cannot
